# Fake Review Detection

This project aims to detect fake reviews using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model implemented in Python with the scikit-learn library. The dataset used for training and testing is labeled by users. The final output includes a mockup of a website that showcases the detection results.

## Features

1. <strong>MLP Model:</strong> Implements a Multi-Layer Perceptron model for binary classification of reviews (fake or real).
2. <strong>User-Labeled Dataset:</strong> Utilizes a dataset labeled manually by users to train and test the model.
3. <strong>Website Mockup:</strong> A simple web interface to display detection results.
